          <h4>The Beatles Rock Baltimore</h4>
          <hr>
          The Beatles’ only visit to Baltimore was on Sunday, September 13, 1964. They performed two shows at the Civic Center, to a total of 28,000 fans. The best seat in the house cost only $3.75. The support acts were The Bill Black Combo, The Exciters, Clarence 'Frogman' Henry, and Jackie  DeShannon. During the day, two girls attempted to have themselves delivered to the venue in a large box labelled 'Beatles fan mail'. Their efforts were thwarted by a guard in charge of checking all deliveries. The Beatles stayed at the Holiday Inn after the second show. Police officers on horseback restrained the fans from storming the building.

          <h4>Led Zepplin In The House</h4>
          <hr>
          <img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NLf6u8PAo4I/VuyvkopglGI/AAAAAAAAGYM/3HCO-XFdyeAvrzZ0NUTol5Ct8tS-fqONQ/s320/51xJb0Y7uvL._SY355_.jpg" alt="" width="300px" height="400px">
          Led Zeppelin, playing to a capacity crowd of nearly 13,000 at the Civic Center Sunday night, amply demonstrated how it became the number one British rock band after the death of the Beatles as a group.
          Led Zeppelin has been known primarily for heavy electronic rock. One of the most pleasant parts of the concert Sunday night was an acoustic interlude with drummer John Bonham laying out and Page, Plant and Jones (playing mandolin) seated before microphones at the front of the stage. They did several songs, including Going to California and Tangerine, the highlight of which was the tight interplay between the mandolin and guitar.
          After this demonstration of their versatility the group settled into their more familiar material – Dazed and Confused and Whole Lotta Love.
          These tunes – very loud, tough and driving rock and roll – are what made Led Zeppelin’s name. Plant’s amazingly mobile voice, as variable an instrument as Page’s guitar and capable of almost as many special effects, is used to its greatest effect here – uncannily echoing the guitar phrases of turning up in the ensemble sound in unexpected but usually correct places. On the strength of this interweaving effect of voice and guitar, Page and Plant probably could get by as a duo.
          For his part, Page has curbed his zeal for excessively long solos – although he uncorked one on Dazed and Confused, that was outstanding mainly for its length, in favor of more pungent statements. He also has given up fretting with the mike stand, an early device and now bows the guitar strings, brandishing the bow high in the air after sawing away at the strings to conduct the after-notes  echoing through the speakers. Page and Led Zeppelin have both come a long way since their first appearance in this area at the Laurel Pop Festival in 1969. (Balt. Sun, June 1972)
